# Hi, I’m Ilya Obryvin 👋

**Senior Product Analyst** (e-commerce / food retail) with **9+ years** in data & product analytics. I help teams ship measurable improvements by combining experimentation, analytics engineering, and decision-ready BI.

- Currently: **Senior Product Analyst @ Lenta** :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Previously: **Data Analyst @ X5 Digital (Vprok.ru)** :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Location: Moscow (remote-first) :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## What I do

### Product analytics & experimentation
- Design and run A/B tests end-to-end (hypotheses → metrics → analysis → rollout).
- Work with tricky retail constraints: seasonality, promo effects, assortment, and multi-channel behavior.

### Analytics engineering & BI
- Build dashboards “from raw data to decision”, including ETL orchestration and BI delivery. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Create reusable metric layers and documentation so analytics scales beyond ad-hoc.

### Stakeholder-ready communication
- Translate business questions into measurable definitions and technical requirements.
- Present results clearly, with practical recommendations and trade-offs.

## Impact highlights (selected)
- Ran **100+ experiments** in product development workflows. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- Built dashboards across the full cycle (ETL orchestration in **Airflow** → BI in **Superset**). :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- Automated reporting by moving from spreadsheets to interactive dashboards (enterprise-grade BI). :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- Built Python automation to process large external datasets at scale (hundreds of archives, thousands of files). :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- Improved retention/ARPU for specific segments via targeted promo/offer experiments and segmentation. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

## Tech stack

**Data / SQL**
- SQL (advanced), PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, Greenplum, Hive (+ experience with Oracle) :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  

**Python**
- pandas, SQLAlchemy, automation for reporting + ad-hoc at scale :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  

**BI / Analytics**
- Superset, Qlik Sense; familiar with Tableau / Power BI / DataLens :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  

**Product toolkit**
- A/B testing, unit economics, segmentation (RFM), metric design :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  

**Workflow**
- Git, Jira, Confluence, Linux/Bash :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}

## Selected work (WIP portfolio)
I’m gradually packaging internal-style work into public, reproducible case studies and utilities.

- **Experimentation utilities**: hashing/assignment helpers, CUPED/CUPAC notes, power/MDE calculators  
- **Retail analytics**: cohort retention patterns, promo impact decomposition, assortment insights  
- **Dashboards & metric layers**: examples of metric definitions + BI-ready datasets

> If you’re a recruiter/hiring manager: I can share anonymized samples and walkthroughs privately.

## Learning & practice
I consistently upskill via structured courses (Stepik and other platforms) and turn the best topics into concise notes and reusable scripts. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  

---

## How I like to work
- **Start with definitions**: precise metric logic beats pretty charts.
- **Bias to automation**: once a question repeats, it becomes a pipeline.
- **Be pragmatic**: perfect models are nice; shipped impact is nicer.
